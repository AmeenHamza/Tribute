                    <b>Mohammad Iqbal (1877-1938)</b>, a descendant of a Kashmiri Brahmin family that had embraced Islam in the
                    seventeenth century, was born and settled in Sialkot. After a traditional education in Arabic,
                    Persian, and Urdu, he was exposed to a liberal education that defined the contours of his thought
                    and his poetry during the entire period of his life. Beginning his educational career at the
                    Scottish Mission School, he went on to acquire his M. A. in Philosophy, before joining Trinity
                    College, and later earning the degree of Bar-at-Law. He furthered his education by getting the
                    degree of doctorate from Germany on The Development of Metaphysics in Persia. He worked in different
                    capacities at different points of time; he taught philosophy, practised law, got involved in
                    politics, and also attended the second Round Table Conference. Even while he favoured the idea of
                    the creation of Pakistan and is venerated there as the national poet, he wrote the famous patriotic
                    song that celebrates the greatness of India. King George V decorated him with knighthood and he was
                    called Sir Mohammad Iqbal thereafter.
                    <br>
                    Iqbal wrote both in Persian and Urdu, and is often regarded as the poet-philosopher of the East who
                    addressed the Muslim ummah, believed in the philosophy of wahdatul wujood, and propounded the
                    philosohy of khudi, or selfhood, which called for self-realisation and the discovery of the hidden
                    talent with love and perseverance. Beyond that lay the stages of complete submission and
                    forgetfulness which, he thought, was the ultimate stage of khudi. Iqbal dreamt of the ‘complete man’
                    and also entered into a metaphoric dialogue with the divine. His poetry emerged as a remarkable site
                    where message and art coalesced, as he re-configured major poetic devices like metaphor, myth, and
                    symbol to re-visit history, philosophy and the Islamic faith to develop his individual vision. He
                    has left behind his collections of poems, Asraar-e Khudi, Rumooz-e Bekhudi, Baang-e Daraa, Baal-e
                    Jibreel, Payaam-e Mashriq, Zaboor-e ‘Ajm, Javed Naama, Zarb-e Kaleem, and Armaghaan-e Hijaz, apart
                    from his lectures collected in English as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, and
                    other works on the Eastern worldview.
